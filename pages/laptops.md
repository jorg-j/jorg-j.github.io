Apple wins for space

Apples screen resolution is better And resolution is better

Apples ecosystem will make backups easier for laptop and phone.

## Additional

After owning a Surface Pro 6 (tablet version similar to the above Surface Go) If I was to buy again I would get the mac.

As much as I am not a fan of either microsoft or apple my preference is always going to be Linux based.

This must be put aside as Linux is not suitable for your use case. In your case I would suggest the Apple.

It fits with your requirements and **should** be suitable for interior design. You should reseach into this more yourself though to be sure.
